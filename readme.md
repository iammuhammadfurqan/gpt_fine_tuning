# GPT Fine-Tuning Pipeline

A modular pipeline to fine-tune GPT models for text generation tasks, with full training, evaluation, and reporting support.

---

## Overview

This project provides an end-to-end solution for fine-tuning GPT models (e.g., GPT-2) on custom datasets. It includes:

- **Data processing** and splitting into train, validation, and test sets.
- **Model training** with configurable hyperparameters.
- **Evaluation** on test data with metrics like Perplexity, BLEU, and ROUGE.
- **Automated report generation** in JSON and human-readable text formats.
- **Sample text generation** for quick qualitative evaluation.

---

## Features

- Configurable model and training parameters via `ModelConfig` and `TrainingConfig`.
- Logging of training progress and results.
- Early stopping and best model checkpointing.
- Detailed performance reports with metric interpretation.
- Sample pitch generation to demonstrate model capabilities.
- Exception handling with informative error logging.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gpt-fine-tuning-pipeline.git
   cd gpt-fine-tuning-pipeline
````

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Configuration

Edit the `main()` function in `main.py` to adjust:

* Model parameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, epochs).
* Training parameters (e.g., data paths, output directories, experiment names).
* Logging and checkpoint settings.

Example snippet:

```python
model_config = ModelConfig(
    model_name="gpt2",
    max_length=128,
    learning_rate=5e-5,
    batch_size=4,
    num_epochs=5,
    ...
)

training_config = TrainingConfig(
    data_path="./data",
    output_dir="./models",
    logs_dir="./logs",
    ...
)
```

---

## Usage

Run the pipeline with:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will:

* Process the data.
* Train the model.
* Evaluate the model on the test set.
* Generate evaluation reports (JSON and TXT).
* Print final metrics.
* Generate sample text outputs based on example prompts.

---

## Output

* **Models and checkpoints** saved under the specified output directory.
* **Logs** stored in the logs directory.
* **Evaluation reports** including:

  * `evaluation_report.json` â€” full metrics and interpretations.
  * `evaluation_report.txt` â€” human-readable report summary.
* **Sample generated texts** printed on the console.

---

## Sample Prompts for Generation

Example prompts used for qualitative checks:

* "Our startup"
* "We are building"
* "Our solution"

---

## Troubleshooting

* Make sure your data files are correctly placed in the data directory.
* Check GPU availability for faster training.
* Review logs in the logs directory for detailed error messages.
